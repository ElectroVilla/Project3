You need to do the following updates in your project:
* Add the Test script(s) to your central package.json file
    -> Backend test script added
    -> Frontend test script added

* Limit the deployment to the master branch
    -> Done and thanks for the hint

* Send the secrets from CircleCi to EB
    -> They were already in the CircleCi but it's my mistake I forgot to add screenshots

* Add a screenshot of the CricleCi secrets into your document
    -> pr15 added
    -> pr16 added

* Update your documentation

* Create and add the Infrastructure and Pipeline diagram
